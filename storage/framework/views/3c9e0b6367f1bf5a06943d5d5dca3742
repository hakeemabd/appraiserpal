Your appraisal report is complete. Please see the deliverables attached in this email. Please
also sign in to your dashboard at <a class="text-primary" href="<?php echo e($host); ?>" target="_blank">www.appraiserpal.com</a> to mark this appraisal as

If you need corrections, you do not have to manually send the report back to us as we already
have the last version of the report. Simply click the left arrow next to your order and fill in the
instructions box with your revision request. If you need to add any photos or other
attachment, use the attachment link in the instruction box.
